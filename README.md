Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)
Overview
This project aims to classify emotions from speech signals using advanced machine learning techniques. It leverages features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and Chroma features to detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise.

Features
Emotion classification using deep learning models (e.g., CNN, LSTM, or hybrid models).

Audio feature extraction for better accuracy.

Support for multiple datasets (e.g., RAVDESS, EMO-DB).

Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher

Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, librosa, matplotlib, numpy, pandas

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/speech-emotion-recognition.git
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Preprocess the audio data:

bash
python preprocess.py
Train the model:

bash
python train.py
Predict emotions:

bash
python predict.py --audio_file path/to/audio.wav
Datasets
RAVDESS: English dataset with 8 emotions.

EMO-DB: German dataset with 7 emotions.

SAVEE: English dataset with 7 emotions.

Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 80% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in emotion recognition.

Future Work
Improve accuracy with hybrid models.

Explore additional datasets for better generalization.

Implement real-time emotion recognition.
